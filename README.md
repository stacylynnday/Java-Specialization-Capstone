# Java-Specialization-Capstone
# Minimum Dominating Set for Directed Graphs
Capstone Project for OO Java Programming: Data Structures and Beyond - Analyzing (Social) Network Data (Coursera)

Finds approximations to the minimum dominating set of a twitter network using different greedy approaches.


# Instructions

- Unzip twitter_combined.txt and put in folder named data (in same dir as java files)

- Run CapGraph.java


# TODOs:
- fix SCC (Strongly Connected Component) method to work for large graphs
- create methods for repeated code
- write MDS method3 and MDS method4 (are these basically the same methods?)
- add a MDS using egonets
- more in-depth research!
